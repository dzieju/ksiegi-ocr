# 📧 Enhanced Mail Search - User Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start

The **Przeszukiwanie Poczty** tab now includes powerful new features for working with your email search results!

## 🔍 How to Use the Enhanced Features

### 1. Searching (Same as Before)
1. Fill in your search criteria (folder, subject, sender, etc.)
2. Choose date period if needed
3. Click **"Rozpocznij wyszukiwanie"**
4. Wait for results to load with real-time progress updates

### 2. 📧 Opening Emails (NEW!)
**Two ways to open emails:**
- **Double-click** on any email row in the results table
- **Single-click** to select, then click **"Otwórz email"** button

**What happens:**
- Email content is saved as a text file in temp folder
- File opens automatically in your default text editor (Notepad, etc.)
- You can read the full email content, including date, sender, subject, and message body

### 3. 📎 Working with Attachments (NEW!)
**To download attachments:**
1. **Click once** on an email that has attachments (shows number in "Załączniki" column)
2. Click the **"Pobierz załączniki"** button
3. All attachments are automatically downloaded to temp folder
4. Temp folder opens automatically in Windows Explorer/File Manager

**Notes:**
- Temp folder is: `C:\Users\[YourName]\AppData\Local\Temp\ksiegi_ocr_attachments\`
- Attachments are saved with safe filenames
- Old attachments are automatically removed on each new search

### 4. 📄 Pagination (NEW!)
**Navigate large result sets easily:**
- **Page Navigation**: Use `< Poprzednia` and `Następna >` buttons
- **Page Info**: See current page position "Strona X z Y"  
- **Results Per Page**: Choose 10, 20, 50, or 100 results using the dropdown
- **Total Count**: See total number of matching emails

### 5. 📏 Window Resizing (NEW!)
**Responsive layout:**
- **Drag window edges** to make the application larger or smaller
- **Results table automatically adapts** to new window width
- **Columns resize** proportionally while maintaining readability
- **All content remains accessible** at any window size

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Efficient Email Review
1. Use **pagination** to browse through large result sets systematically
2. **Double-click emails** for quick preview without using buttons
3. Set **results per page to 20-50** for optimal performance with large searches
4. **Resize window wider** to see more of long email subjects and sender names

### Working with Attachments
1. Look for **numbers in "Załączniki" column** to identify emails with attachments
2. **Download all attachments at once** - no need to download individually  
3. **Temp folder stays open** so you can easily work with multiple attachment sets
4. **Files are automatically organized** by search - old files removed on new searches

### Search Optimization  
1. Use **date periods** to limit results and improve performance
2. **Start with broad searches**, then use pagination to review systematically
3. **Subject and sender filters** work great with the new pagination system
4. **Attachment filters** now show exact counts in the results table

## 🎯 What's New vs. Old

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Results Display** | Plain text list | Interactive sortable table |
| **Email Opening** | Not possible | Double-click or button |
| **Attachments** | View count only | Download and open |
| **Large Results** | Limited to ~100 | Paginated browsing |
| **Window Size** | Fixed width | Fully responsive |
| **Navigation** | Scroll only | Page-based navigation |

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Email Won't Open
- **Check**: Make sure you have a default text editor set in Windows
- **Try**: Right-click on the temp file → "Open with" → Choose Notepad

### Attachments Not Downloading  
- **Check**: Email actually has attachments (number > 0 in results)
- **Verify**: You have write permissions to temp folder
- **Try**: Run application as administrator if needed

### Pagination Not Working
- **Wait**: Let current search complete before clicking pagination
- **Check**: Results are actually larger than your "per page" setting
- **Refresh**: Start a new search if pagination seems stuck

### Window Resizing Issues
- **Minimum size**: Don't make window too small - some elements need minimum space
- **Try**: Reset by closing and reopening the application
- **Check**: Screen resolution supports the window size you're trying to use
