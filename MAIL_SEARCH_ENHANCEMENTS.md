# Enhanced Mail Search Implementation

## Summary of Changes

This implementation extends the mail search functionality with three main enhancements as requested:

### 1. Email and Attachment Opening Features

**Changes Made:**
- **Enhanced Search Results**: Modified `search_engine.py` to store full email objects and attachment information
- **Interactive Results Display**: Replaced text-based `ScrolledText` with interactive `Treeview` in `results_display.py`
- **Direct Email Opening**: Added "Otwórz email" button and double-click support to open emails in default text editor
- **Attachment Management**: Added "Pobierz załączniki" button that downloads attachments to `./temp` folder and opens it
- **Temp Folder Management**: Automatically creates temp directory and overwrites files on new searches

**Technical Details:**
- Email content is exported to `.txt` files in temp folder
- Attachments are downloaded with safe filenames to prevent conflicts
- Uses `os.startfile()` on Windows and `xdg-open` on Linux for system integration
- Error handling for missing or corrupted attachments

### 2. Pagination System

**Changes Made:**
- **Pagination Controls**: Added Previous/Next buttons with page information display
- **Configurable Results**: Added dropdown to select 10, 20, 50, or 100 results per page
- **Search Engine Enhancement**: Modified search logic to support `page` and `per_page` parameters
- **Performance Optimization**: Limited total search to 500 results to maintain performance
- **Status Display**: Shows current page, total pages, and total result count

**Technical Details:**
- Pagination is handled in `_threaded_search()` method with proper offset calculation
- Results are filtered first, then paginated to ensure consistent filtering across pages
- Page state is maintained in `MailSearchTab` class
- Thread-safe pagination updates through existing queue system

### 3. Dynamic Window Width Adaptation

**Changes Made:**
- **Grid Configuration**: Updated `ui_builder.py` to use `sticky="nsew"` and proper weight configuration
- **Responsive Layout**: Results area now expands/contracts with main window resizing
- **Column Sizing**: Treeview columns have minimum widths but can expand
- **Hierarchical Sizing**: All parent containers properly configured for weight distribution

**Technical Details:**
- Added `grid_rowconfigure()` and `grid_columnconfigure()` with `weight=1`
- Results frame uses row 9 with weight 1 to get all extra vertical space
- Columns 0, 1, 2 all have weight 1 for horizontal expansion
- Treeview automatically adjusts column widths based on available space

## File Changes

### `gui/mail_search_components/search_engine.py`
- Added pagination parameters to `search_emails_threaded()` and `_threaded_search()`
- Enhanced result data structure to include `message_obj`, `message_id`, and `attachments`
- Fixed parameter names to match UI variables (`subject_search`, `selected_period`)
- Improved performance with limited result sets and better progress reporting

### `gui/mail_search_components/results_display.py`
- **Complete rewrite** from text-based to interactive Treeview display
- Added pagination UI (Previous/Next buttons, page info, results per page selector)
- Added action buttons (Open Email, Download Attachments)
- Implemented temp folder management and file opening functionality
- Added proper grid configuration for dynamic window sizing
- Added double-click and selection change event handling

### `gui/mail_search_components/ui_builder.py`
- Modified `create_results_widget()` to return a frame instead of ScrolledText
- Added proper grid weight configuration for dynamic resizing
- Removed unused ScrolledText import

### `gui/tab_mail_search.py`
- Added pagination state management (`current_page`, `per_page`)
- Enhanced `_handle_result()` to support pagination information
- Added `go_to_page()` and `change_per_page()` methods for pagination callbacks
- Updated widget creation to use new frame-based results display

## User Interface Changes

### Before:
- Simple text area showing search results in fixed-width columns
- No interaction possible with results
- Fixed window width, no responsive design
- All results displayed at once (limited to 100)

### After:
- Interactive table (Treeview) with sortable columns and selection
- Action buttons: "Otwórz email" and "Pobierz załączniki"  
- Pagination controls: "< Poprzednia" | "Strona X z Y" | "Następna >"
- Results per page selector: dropdown with 10/20/50/100 options
- Dynamic window width - results area expands with window
- Total results counter: "Znaleziono: X wyników"
- Double-click to open emails directly

## Backwards Compatibility

- All existing search functionality is preserved
- Threading architecture remains unchanged
- Exchange connection and authentication unchanged
- Search criteria and filtering logic maintained
- Progress reporting and cancellation still work

## Error Handling

- Graceful handling of missing email objects
- Safe filename creation for attachments
- Proper cleanup of temporary files
- User feedback for failed operations
- Thread-safe error reporting through existing queue system

This implementation provides a significantly enhanced user experience while maintaining the existing architecture and ensuring robust operation.
