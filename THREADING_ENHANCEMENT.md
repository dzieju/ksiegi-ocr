# Multithreading Enhancement for Invoice Search

## Overview

This enhancement introduces multithreading capabilities to the `gui/tab_invoice_search.py` module to improve performance and user experience when processing PDF attachments during invoice searches.

## Problem Solved

**Before**: The invoice search function processed PDF attachments sequentially in the main GUI thread, causing:
- GUI freezing during PDF processing
- Poor user experience with no feedback during long operations
- No ability to cancel long-running searches
- Slow processing of multiple PDF attachments

**After**: PDF attachments are processed concurrently using a thread pool, providing:
- Responsive GUI that remains interactive during searches
- Real-time progress updates
- Ability to cancel long-running searches
- Significant performance improvement for multiple PDFs

## Key Features

### 1. Concurrent PDF Processing
- Uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` with up to 4 worker threads
- Processes multiple PDF attachments simultaneously
- Maintains thread safety with proper synchronization

### 2. Non-Blocking GUI
- Search operations run in background threads
- GUI remains responsive during processing
- Real-time progress updates without freezing

### 3. Progress Tracking
- Shows current attachment being processed
- Displays overall progress (X/Y attachments)
- Real-time status updates in the interface

### 4. Cancellation Support
- Search button becomes "Cancel" button during operation
- Ability to stop long-running searches
- Proper cleanup of resources when cancelled

### 5. Thread-Safe Communication
- Uses `queue.Queue` for thread-safe message passing
- GUI updates only occur on the main thread
- Safe handling of results and progress updates

## Technical Implementation

### New Components

1. **Threading Variables**:
   - `search_cancelled`: Flag to signal cancellation
   - `search_executor`: ThreadPoolExecutor for PDF processing
   - `result_queue`: Queue for results from worker threads
   - `progress_queue`: Queue for progress updates
   - `search_thread`: Main search thread

2. **Queue Processing Methods**:
   - `_process_result_queue()`: Handles results from worker threads
   - `_process_progress_queue()`: Handles progress updates

3. **Worker Function**:
   - `_process_pdf_attachment()`: Processes individual PDF attachments
   - Runs in worker threads with proper error handling

4. **Modified Search Logic**:
   - `search_invoices()`: Now starts background thread
   - `_threaded_search()`: Main search logic running in background
   - `toggle_search()`: Handles start/cancel functionality

### Thread Safety Measures

1. **Queue-Based Communication**: All data exchange between threads uses thread-safe queues
2. **GUI Updates**: Only the main thread updates GUI elements using `tkinter.after()`
3. **Resource Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of threads and temporary files
4. **Exception Handling**: Robust error handling prevents thread crashes

## Usage

The interface remains the same for users:

1. **Starting a Search**: Click "Szukaj faktur" button
2. **During Search**: 
   - Button text changes to "Anuluj wyszukiwanie"
   - Progress updates appear in real-time
   - GUI remains responsive
3. **Canceling**: Click the "Anuluj wyszukiwanie" button
4. **Completion**: Button returns to "Szukaj faktur", final results shown

## Performance Benefits

- **Concurrent Processing**: Multiple PDFs processed simultaneously
- **Improved Responsiveness**: GUI never freezes
- **Better User Experience**: Real-time feedback and cancellation
- **Scalable**: Performance improves with number of PDF attachments

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive testing of the threading logic to ensure:
- Proper concurrent PDF processing
- Thread-safe result collection
- Correct progress reporting
- Resource cleanup

## Compatibility

- Maintains full backward compatibility
- No changes to external API
- Same functionality with improved performance
- Works with existing Exchange configuration and PDF processing

## Error Handling

- Thread-safe error handling and logging
- Graceful degradation on threading issues
- Proper cleanup of resources on errors
- Preserves application stability
