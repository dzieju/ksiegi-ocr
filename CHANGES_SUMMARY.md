# Tab_zakupy.py Changes Summary

## Changes Made

This document summarizes the changes made to `gui/tab_zakupy.py` to address the requirements:

### 1. Remove [FAKTURA] Prefixes
- **Issue**: The requirement was to ensure invoice numbers are displayed exactly as OCR recognized them, without additional [FAKTURA] labels
- **Fix**: Fixed a bug in the display logic where `display_line` was only defined for lines containing invoice numbers (line 276), but used for all lines (line 283)
- **Solution**: Now all lines use `'line': line` directly (lines 273-278), ensuring they're displayed exactly as OCR recognized them

### 2. Set Fixed Width to 10 cm
- **Issue**: Text area had dynamic width that started at 100 characters and resized to 50% (50 characters) after processing
- **Fix**: Set text area to fixed width of 47 characters (line 331), which corresponds to approximately 10 cm for typical monospace fonts at 96 DPI
- **Removed**: Dynamic width resizing logic from both the threaded processing (lines 143-146) and old synchronous function (lines 383-385)

## Technical Details

### Before Changes:
```python
# Dynamic width - started at 100, resized to 50% after processing
self.text_area = ScrolledText(self, wrap="word", width=100, height=25)

# Later, after processing:
current_width = self.text_area.cget("width")
new_width = int(current_width * 0.5)  # 50 characters
self.text_area.config(width=new_width)

# Bug: display_line only defined for invoice lines
if self.contains_invoice_number(line):
    invoice_count += 1
    display_line = line  # Only set here!
# But used for all lines later:
'line': display_line  # Undefined for non-invoice lines!
```

### After Changes:
```python
# Fixed width - 47 characters (~10 cm)
self.text_area = ScrolledText(self, wrap="word", width=47, height=25)

# No dynamic resizing - removed all width manipulation code

# Clean display logic - all lines shown exactly as OCR recognized
if self.contains_invoice_number(line):
    invoice_count += 1  # Just count, don't modify display
# All lines displayed as-is:
'line': line  # Always uses original OCR text
```

## Width Calculation
- 10 cm at 96 DPI = ~378 pixels
- For monospace fonts, this translates to approximately 47 characters
- This provides consistent width regardless of window resizing

## Files Modified
- `gui/tab_zakupy.py`: Main implementation changes

## Testing
- All syntax checks pass
- Import tests pass
- Width correctly set to 47 characters
- Lines displayed exactly as OCR recognized
- Dynamic resizing completely removed
- Screenshots provided showing the UI changes
